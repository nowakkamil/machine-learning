The repository contains _k-nearest neighbor_ algorithm implementation in **python**.

The _k-NN_ is a method used for **classification** and **regression**. The training examples are vectors in a multidimensional feature space, each with a class label. The training phase of the algorithm consists only of storing the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples. The _k-NN_ is a type of **instance-based learning**, or **lazy learning**, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.

The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. The program incorporates unit test based on **Iris dataset**, which is a classic example in the field of machine learning. The Iris dataset contains the measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: _Setosa_, _Versicolor_, and _Viriginica_.
